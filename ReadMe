SETUP:

1. First, create the .env file:
```
nano .env
```

2. Then, copy and paste the following into the .env file:
```
# PostgreSQL settings
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
POSTGRES_DB=pooler_db

# Django settings
SQL_ENGINE=django.db.backends.postgresql
SQL_DATABASE=pooler_db
SQL_USER=postgres
SQL_PASSWORD=postgres
SQL_HOST=db
SQL_PORT=5432
```

2. Now build and run the Docker containers:
```
docker-compose build
```

3. Then, start the containers:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

4. To check the running containers:
```
docker-compose ps
```


The series of messages from MEGAMAILER.TO's CEO outlines a project to improve and enhance an existing codebase. Here is a detailed breakdown of the technical requirements and suggestions provided:

1. **Implement a Database System**:
   - Use PostgreSQL as the database for the system.
   - This involves integrating PostgreSQL with the existing codebase to handle data storage and retrieval efficiently.

2. **Improve or Correct the Existing Code**:
   - Review the current code from the provided Git repository.
   - Identify areas for improvement or correction, particularly focusing on speed, efficiency, and reliability.

3. **Add IMAP Part**:
   - Implement IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) functionality that is currently missing from the system.
   - This likely involves enabling the system to connect to email servers, fetch emails, and possibly handle other email-related operations.

4. **MX Lookup**:
   - Add functionality for MX (Mail Exchange) lookup.
   - This is crucial for determining the mail servers responsible for receiving emails on behalf of a domain, which can help in sending emails accurately.

5. **Improve Locks and Thread Safety**:
   - Address the issue of numerous locks that are impacting speed and efficiency.
   - Implement thread-safe counter classes or structures to improve performance.
   - Ensure that loading and unloading data to/from the disk is optimized.

6. **Frontend Improvements**:
   - Simplify the frontend by removing the rich CLI (Command Line Interface) layer.
   - Ensure that global dictionaries are improved for thread safety and that counters are updated and accessible.

7. **Team Coordination and Deadline**:
   - The team is expected to decide on the approach and work together to meet the deadline.
   - The deadline for completing the project, including debugging, is three days.

### Action Plan:
1. **Database Integration**:
   - Integrate PostgreSQL with the current system.
   - Migrate any existing data to PostgreSQL if necessary.

2. **Code Review and Optimization**:
   - Review the provided Git repository for areas that need improvement or correction.
   - Focus on optimizing the code for better performance.

3. **IMAP Implementation**:
   - Implement the missing IMAP functionality to handle email retrieval and processing.

4. **MX Lookup Functionality**:
   - Add the MX lookup feature to the system for better email handling.

5. **Thread Safety and Performance**:
   - Resolve issues with locks and ensure thread safety.
   - Use appropriate data structures to maintain thread safety and improve performance.

6. **Frontend Simplification**:
   - Remove unnecessary complexity from the CLI layer.
   - Ensure the frontend remains functional with improved thread-safe counters.

### Next Steps:
**a.** Integrate PostgreSQL into the existing codebase and migrate any necessary data.
**b.** Conduct a detailed review of the provided code repository to identify and fix issues affecting performance and reliability.

Let's break down the requirements into more detailed and manageable tasks. We will structure the tasks into three main parts for clarity: database integration, code improvements, and functionality additions. Hereâ€™s a detailed plan for each part:

### Part 1: Database Integration

Step 1: Set Up PostgreSQL
- Install PostgreSQL on the server or development environment.
- Create a database for the project.

Step 2: Integrate PostgreSQL with the Codebase
- Identify all parts of the code that require database interaction.
- Replace existing data storage methods with PostgreSQL queries.
- Implement connection pooling for efficient database connections.

Step 3: Data Migration
- If there is existing data, write scripts to migrate it to the new PostgreSQL database.
- Ensure data integrity and consistency during the migration process.

### Part 2: Code Improvements and Optimization

Step 1: Code Review
- Clone the provided Git repository.
- Review the codebase to understand its structure and functionality.
- Identify areas with potential for optimization and refactoring.

Step 2: Optimize Locking Mechanisms
- Review and optimize the current locking mechanisms to reduce overhead.
- Implement thread-safe counters and data structures where needed.

Step 3: Improve Disk I/O
- Analyze current disk I/O operations.
- Optimize data loading and unloading to improve performance.
- Implement caching where applicable to reduce disk access frequency.

### Part 3: Functionality Additions

Step 1: Implement IMAP Functionality
- Add code to connect to IMAP servers and fetch emails.
- Handle email parsing and processing within the system.

Step 2: Add MX Lookup Functionality
- Implement MX record lookup using libraries such as dnspython.
- Integrate MX lookup results into the email sending logic to ensure correct routing.

Step 3: Frontend Simplification
- Remove unnecessary complexity from the CLI layer.
- Ensure the frontend remains functional and user-friendly.
- Improve thread safety for global dictionaries and counters.

### Next Steps

a. Integrate PostgreSQL into the existing codebase and migrate any necessary data.
b. Conduct a detailed review of the provided code repository to identify and fix issues affecting performance and reliability.
